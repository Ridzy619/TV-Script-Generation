# TV-Script-Generation
This project seeks to create a Natural Language generative model using RNN.

The dataset that was used was one of Jerry Senfield TV scripts.

The model was trained for 5 epochs with the loss reaching 3.45 at the end of the final epoch.

The model parameters are as follows:
1. learning rate: 0.0003
2. batch size: 100
3. sequence length: 100
4. number of layers: 2
5. hidden dimension: 300
6. embebedding dimension: 300
